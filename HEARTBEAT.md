# HEARTBEAT.md

## Autonomous Web Research Monitor (Level-3)

Run this checklist when heartbeat triggers.

### 1) Collect
- Telegram: check new inbound context from tracked conversations/channels.
- X/Twitter: collect only from approved accounts/keywords already seen in user context.
- YouTube: collect only from approved channels/keywords already seen in user context.
- Web: collect only from whitelisted domains already provided by user.

### 2) Filter (strict)
- Skip ads/ref links unless core content has analytical value.
- Skip items with low content value (too short/no signal).
- Deduplicate:
  - same URL -> skip
  - near-duplicate text similarity > 80% -> skip

### 3) Limits
- Max 12 saved materials/day total.
- Max 3 saved materials/source/day.

### 4) Extract
For each saved item generate:
- Source (URL / channel / author / date)
- Summary (short)
- Key points (3-7)
- Tags (3-6)
- Relevance (low/med/high)
- Action/Idea (if any)
- Fact vs Opinion separation; uncertain claims => mark as hypothesis.

### 5) Store
- 00_Inbox: raw intake
- 10_Channels: source-specific notes
- 20_Summaries: refined summaries/digests
- 90_MOC: topic indexes/links

### 6) Connect
- Link to related existing notes and tags.

### 7) Report
- Send max 5-bullet brief update only when there is meaningful new signal.
- If no meaningful updates, stay silent.

### Daily/Weekly outputs
- Daily Intelligence Brief (short, ~1 screen).
- Weekly Digest + metrics: X notes / Y ideas / Z voice / W links.
